Here a csv file from Spotify is being used to count the amount of times an artist appears on the top charts and places them in alphabetical order. A sorted linked list is being used to alphabetize the artist via the insertFirst function. A 2D array is being used to count the amount of times the artist appeared on the charts and organizes them to be inserted into the sorted linked list. A collections based array was used to delete duplicates.
